    "# Examining Racial Discrimination in the US Job Market\n",
    "\n",
    "### Background\n",
    "Racial discrimination continues to be pervasive in cultures throughout the world. Researchers examined the level of racial discrimination in the United States labor market by randomly assigning identical résumés to black-sounding or white-sounding names and observing the impact on requests for interviews from employers.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Data\n",
    "In the dataset provided, each row represents a resume. The 'race' column has two values, 'b' and 'w', indicating black-sounding and white-sounding. The column 'call' has two values, 1 and 0, indicating whether the resume received a call from employers or not.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that the 'b' and 'w' values in race are assigned randomly to the resumes when presented to the employer."

    "   4. Write a story describing the statistical significance in the context or the original problem.\n",
    "   5. Does your analysis mean that race/name is the most important factor in callback success? Why or why not? If not, how would you amend your analysis?\n",

    "### Data methodology considerations\n",
    "#### This experiment's design was through but still, has limitations. Since the race is only suggested (in the form of a stereotypical name) and not outright stated, it is not known if each potential employer makes a racial assumption based on applicants name.  Also, only the areas of Boston and Chicago were sent the fake job applications. Both of these cities are large US cities, with relatively high racial diversity compared to smaller US cities and both of are in the Northern US. Any results gained from this data may not be representative of large Southern or Western US cities or smaller cities.  They also only tested four occupational categories, which further limits the scope of the study. Additionally, all job ads were found exclusively in Sunday newspapers of one newspaper for each city.  How this might affect the study is not known, but some problems that might occur are as follows:\n",
    "* Employer company/person must be large(profitable) enough to afford ads in major newspaper\n",
    "* May introduce age/generational bias, as companies run by older generation may be more inclined to advertise in a newspaper instead of online\n",
